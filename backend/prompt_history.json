Ruled by an assembly of intelligent crows, this mystical realm was a marvel of dark magic and avian ingenuity. The air reeked of damp earth and decay, as if the very forest itself had given up its essence to the crows.\n\nAt the heart of Corvus stood the sprawling Citadel of Black Feathers, its battlements crafted from twisted branches and gleaming jet-black tiles that seemed to absorb the faint light filtering through the canopy. The kingdom's ruler, the enigmatic Queen Raven, perched upon her throne, her piercing gaze surveying the gathered courtiers and advisors. Her iridescent feathers glimmered like polished opals in the flickering torchlight as she listened intently to the whispers of her most trusted counselor, a wispy, gray-crowned crow named Whisper.\n\nRumors had begun to spread, whispers that a young apprentice, Kael Darkfire, had stumbled upon an ancient tome hidden deep within the woods. The artifact was said to hold the secrets of Corvus's forgotten magic, a power capable of reviving the kingdom's withering crops and replenishing its dwindling resources. As Queen Raven deliberated on how to extract the knowledge from Kael, the whispers grew louder \u2013 treacherous forces lurked beyond the forest's borders, seeking to exploit Corvus's vulnerability for their own gain.
